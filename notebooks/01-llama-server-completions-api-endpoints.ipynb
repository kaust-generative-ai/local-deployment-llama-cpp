    "Even though all models have a finite context window, a value of -1 will enable *infinite* text generation. How? When the context window is full half of the tokens after `n_keep` will be discarded. The context must then be re-evaluated before generation can resume. On large models and/or large context windows, this can result in a significant pause in output. If the output delay is undesirable, a value of -2 will stop generation immediately when the context is filled.\n",

    "It is important to note that the generated text may be shorter than the specified number of tokens if an End-of-Sequence (EOS) token or a reverse prompt is encountered. In interactive mode, text generation will pause and control will be returned to the user. In non-interactive mode, the program will end. In both cases, the text generation may stop before reaching the specified `n_predict` value. If you want the model to keep going without ever producing End-of-Sequence on its own, you can use the `ignore_eos` parameter.\n",

       "* **Cloud coverage:** Clouds block the sunlight and scatter less light, resulting in a less blue sky.\n",
